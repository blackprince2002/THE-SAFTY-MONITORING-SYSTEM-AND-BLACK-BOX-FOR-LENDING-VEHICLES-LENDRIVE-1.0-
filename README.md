# THE-SAFTY-MONITORING-SYSTEM-AND-BLACK-BOX-FOR-LENDING-VEHICLES-LENDRIVE-1.0-
We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all those who have contributed to the successful completion of our project, "Safety Monitoring System and Blackbox for Lending Vehicles." This project aimed to reduce road accidents by detecting factors such as rain and alcohol consumption, as well as controlling the speed of the vehicle and sending SMS alerts. The project would not have been possible without the support and guidance of several individuals.
We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to our project supervisor, Mr. Kavinga Yapa, whose expertise, guidance, and unwavering support were invaluable throughout the entire project. Their insights and encouragement played a crucial role in shaping our ideas and ensuring the project's success.
We are also grateful to our co-supervisor, Mr. Jaliya Wijayaraja, for their valuable input, feedback, and assistance in navigating the complexities of the project. Their dedication to our project, as well as their mentorship, greatly contributed to its overall quality and achievement.
Furthermore, we would like to acknowledge our lecturer, Ms. Shashika Lokuliyana, whose teaching and guidance provided us with the foundational knowledge and skills necessary to undertake this project. Their commitment to fostering our understanding and passion for the subject matter has been instrumental in our development.
Finally, we extend our thanks to our fellow team members, friends, and family, who provided support and encouragement throughout the project's duration.
We are truly appreciative of the collective efforts that have made this project a reality, and we hope that the outcomes of our work contribute to the enhancement of safety on the roads.
